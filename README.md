# RAYTRACING
I've been doing game dev for quite some time and recently I became more curious about how the tools I use, in my workflow - work. 
More specifically, the rendering side of engines like Unreal or 3D modelling tools like Maya has always been a huge black box to me.
Ultimately, this inspired the motivation for this project: to build a raytracing framework, from scratch. Here are some of my renders:
