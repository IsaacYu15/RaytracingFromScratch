# RAYTRACING
I've been doing game dev for quite some time and recently I became more curious about how the tools I use, in my workflow - work. 
More specifically, the rendering side of engines like Unreal or 3D modelling tools like Maya has always been a huge black box to me.
Ultimately, this inspired the motivation for this project: to build a raytracing framework, from scratch.

My notes are very much a work in progress but they are [here](https://hungry-tray-2e2.notion.site/RAYTRACING-FROM-SCRATCH-4053ea725f994ca787ef0a7a890eeb55?pvs=74) if you would like to see what resources I used to learn this:

Here are some of my renders / documentation of my progress :)
